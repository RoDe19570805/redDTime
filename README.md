# redDTime

   redDTime defines a class for date and time description in the form of @redD-taks'redD-tiks@ 

### basic information

   Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web in March 1989 and his second proposal 
   in May 1990. Together with Belgian systems engineer Robert Cailliau, this paper was finalized as a 
   management proposal dated November 12, 1990. It outlined the main concepts and defined important terms 
   behind the Web. The document described a "hypertext project" called the "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" 
   of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by "browsers."

   redDTime shows that a new era began on November 12, 1990 by displaying the time that has passed since 
   then. However, redDTime does not display the time that has passed in the usual form of years, months, 
   days, hours, minutes and seconds, but in redD-taks and redD-tiks.
